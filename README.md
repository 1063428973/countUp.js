countUp.js
==========

countUp.js is a dependency-free, lightweight JavaScript "class" that can be used to quickly create animations that display numerical data in a more interesting way.

### Usage:
    var numAnim = new countUp("SomeElementYouWantToAnimate", 99.99, 2, 1.5)
    numAnim.start()

Pretty easy hey?
